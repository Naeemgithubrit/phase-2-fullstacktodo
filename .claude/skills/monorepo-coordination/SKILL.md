# Monorepo Coordination

## Instructions
1. Maintain clear separation between frontend and backend.
2. Ensure specs remain authoritative.
3. Coordinate cross stack changes carefully.
4. Prevent duplication of logic.
5. Enforce repository structure conventions.

## Examples
- Updating both API specs and backend code together.
- Ensuring frontend changes align with backend contracts.
- Preventing business logic from leaking into UI components.
