# Spec Driven Validation

## Instructions
1. Read all relevant specifications before making any decision.
2. Treat specifications as the single source of truth.
3. Ensure every behavior is explicitly defined in a spec.
4. Validate implementation against acceptance criteria.
5. Reject undocumented or out of scope functionality.
6. Require specification updates if behavior changes.

## Examples
- Checking a backend endpoint against the REST API specification before implementing it.
- Verifying a frontend feature matches the feature acceptance criteria.
- Detecting behavior that exists in code but not in any spec file.
