# REST API Implementation

## Instructions
1. Define endpoints using REST conventions.
2. Use clear HTTP methods for each operation.
3. Validate request and response data.
4. Enforce authentication on all endpoints.
5. Return consistent JSON responses.
6. Handle errors with appropriate HTTP status codes.

## Examples
- Implementing GET and POST endpoints for task resources.
- Returning 401 when an authorization token is missing.
- Using 404 for resources that do not belong to the authenticated user.
